## Clock

For this task, you have to create a clock via 2 different methods:
  - Vanilla HTML, CSS
  - HTML Canvas API
  
The Canvas API was introduced with HTML5 and is used to render graphics on a webpage using geometric specifications. It highly simplifies animation and drawing and hence, we expect you to develop a good enough understanding of the same.

_Note: Don't spend too much time styling the clock. It should be plain and simple. Focus more on functionality._
