## Game Time

For this task, replicate the hit game 2048, using only vanilla JS. *You cannot use any other libraries*.
The game must be responsive and must include the original game animations. Try to replicate the game completely in both visual and operational aspects. As an add-on , also consider adding support for touch control :wink:
