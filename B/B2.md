## Multiple Select

For this task, create a list of items with a checkbox for each item, similar to what is on the left. the checkboxes can be checked individually. But if an item is checked pressing the “Shift key”, all  items between last checked and current item (inclusive) should get selected, similar to what you would see in Windows/Mac file systems.
