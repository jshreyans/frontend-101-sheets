## Form Validator

Form validation basically entails parsing user entered data and checking it for inconsistencies. Forms include text-fields (that can contain pure strings, numbers), dropdowns and more importantly, emails. Sometimes the users enter erronous data, either willingy or unwillingly, and these can lead to serious problems when processed by your server. Hence, it is important to validate user entered data on the client side itself and make the user aware of these errors. 

You will make a simple form that contains the following text-fields:
Name*, Email*, Phone*, Password*

Apart from these, there should be dropdowns for the following:
Events for participation*, Year of study, Gender 

_Fields marked with * are required_ 

Look at popular customer signup websites like Amazon, Gmail etc and try to replicate their UX in your form. Provide informative error/success messages, alerts and confirmations as to where the user has made a mistake. 

Constraints on password:
- max-length: 15
- min-length: 8
- allow only alphanumerics and special symbols from the US keyboard
- should not contain name of user (Even if case has been changed. So if the name is Alex, then alex, Alex, aLeX are all invalid)
- should contain at least one number and one special symbol
