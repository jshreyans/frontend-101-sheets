## Github Profile Fetcher

For this task, you'll be learning how to send HTTP requests over a network. This is the basis for the communication between a website/webapp and a server and as a developer, knowing how to implement this feature is very crucial. Developing any concrete application is almost impossible without some frontend-backend interaction. 

There are various methods of sending HTTP requests. These are:
    - The XMLHttpRequest object
    - Using Jquery/AJAX
    - Using the Fetch API (this is the latest and most suggested-for-use method)

Although you'll be using only the Fetch API mostly, it is important to be familiar with the other 2 methods as well.

For this task, create a Github profile fethcer. Your page should contain an input box where the user can enter a Github handle. You have to fetch the corresponding user's Github display picture (called avatar), name and their description and display these in an appropriate format. Remeber to handle any exceptions.
