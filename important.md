# Things to keep in mind

1. **Comment and Document** - Good developers document the code they write. This will be useful in all future jobs and even in GSoC. Write crisp comments wherever necessary so that anyone new to your codebase can understand what's happening.
2. **Feedback** - At times, we might ask you to redo a task or try a different approach. Try to incorporate those changes but don't hesitate to ask for hints or resoures.
3. **Tasks** - You have already completed some of these tasks during your recruitment. However, instead of skipping these or using the same code, at this stage, we expect you to provide a better and more efficient solution.
4. **Order** - Remember that the order in which you complete these tasks is not important. But try to pick up a new task only when one is complete
5. **Patience** - Some tasks will require you to read extensively. For eg. one of the tasks requires you to read the Chrome Extension API documentation. This can be daunting and boring, but develop a habit to look only for what is required. In the future, you will find yourself reading documentation and implementing that code at the same time. So bear with the developers and dig in!
