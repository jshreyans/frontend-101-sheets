## Follow Along Cards

Create a simple navigation menu containing 3-4 items. These can be Home, AboutUs, Contact etc. Each element should be in a distinct box. Now whenever the user hovers over an item, a card should appear below it containing different information/items. Try to implement smooth and subtle animations.

Points to keep in mind:
    - The cards should resize according to the content to be displayed
    - Do _not_ hard-code the dimensions in if-else clauses. Develop a suitable logic to calculate dimnensions
