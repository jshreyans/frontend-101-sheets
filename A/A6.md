For this task, recreate the image below using only HTML and CSS (No inline SVG).
 
Next, recreate the Species in Pieces effect by making a “V” and an “M” in Adobe Illustrator using same number of triangles and then animating this as D-V-M. Use [this](../ss/D.svg) SVG to start your work.

Go to [this](https://jshreyans.github.io/frontend-101/A/8.html) link to test out the demo. Closely observe the timing of the animation.
