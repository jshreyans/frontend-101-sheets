## Trippy Grid

Create a responsive grid structure using flexboxes or CSS grids. The number of columns will be different for different screen sizes, going from 4 on 1080x720 display (laptop) to 1 on 320x568 display (iPhoneSE). The boxes should keep translating horizontally as shown below.

You can go to [this](link) to see how it should look. Try resizing the window and notice the changes in the translation of the boxes.
